# DAMI-II
Welcome to our project repository for the DAMI II course at Stockholm university. 

This repository contains the code for our project, contributed by 
Niklas Besuden , Phi-Hung Andr√© Hoang  and Charalampos Souris.

In this project, we will be using the OpenAI model GPT-3 and a 
fine-tuned version of a BERT model to compare which model is more efficient
for NLP tasks.
